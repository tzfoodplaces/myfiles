<p><strong>PILAU CUISINE.</strong><br>The flavor of Tanzanian foods has left a profound impression after tasting them on ones tongue And, one will experience a fantastic feeling if you he or she gets a chance to try them. The flavor of Tanzanian food and recipes always makes people flutter and get the feeling to want to eat more and more. Despite all the recipes prepared still Tanzanian dishes taste the best mostly if prepared by the locals. There are a lot of amazing traditional Tanzanian foods you should definitely try when visiting the country, but not just that. There are also a lot of these dishes prepared internationally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/84930a4e44f490f04484d17ee103c49c-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6039" width="840" height="561" srcset="https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/84930a4e44f490f04484d17ee103c49c-1.jpg 735w, https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/84930a4e44f490f04484d17ee103c49c-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></figure>



<p><br>Like in many countries ,food is among the basic need required for survival and speaking of home made food ( Tanzania food),it is the best.The tasty meals made in Tanzania have not only made people to get their basic need but also food has served as a source of income and a tourist attraction to foreigners interested to learn our culture which includes the delicious meals that are prepared with uniqueness and which are nutritious.<br>Among all dishes served in Tanzania ,I would love to talk about the Tanzania most popular food which is the pilau nyama(spiced rice with meat).</p>



<p><br>Pilau also called pilaf(US spelling) is a rice dish which involves addition of spices with either beef,goat or chicken .Also some prefer to add vegetables like green peas ,carrots,onions and bell peppers to add flavor.This dish is cooked by spices like cumin ,cloves,cardamom and cinnamon also irish potatoes may be added,the mixture of all those when cooked to perfection it forms a nice tasty dish that will make one want to eat more and more.When cooking pilau one may prefer to use direct spices from the market or use pilau masala which is a mixture of black peppercorns, cloves,cumin, cardamom,ginger and cinnamon all in powder form.All that mixture in the masala provides a nice arouma and brown color of the pilau.<br><strong>The pilau masala has got a lot of health benefits that is why is mostly preferred,these include,</strong><br>⦁ It helps to aid one’s digestion<br>⦁ It provides strong antioxidants<br>⦁ It regulates blood pressure<br>⦁ It improved the heart health<br>⦁ It reduced inflammation<br>⦁ It lowers cancer risk<br>⦁ It fight oral bacteria<br>⦁ It enhances nutrient absorbtion<br>⦁ It defends against diabetes</p>



<p>In any restaurant one will never miss pilau in the menu since it is really a popular food. It is also preferred in different ceremonies like weddings,also in festivals like Christmas periods,New year and Eid.So one can frequently have taste of this delicious Tanzanian food. The outcome of pilau mixture is very similar to the western africa dish called jollof. However,the two meals are not the same and spices used to make pilau are very different from those used to make jollof rice.<br>The rice used to make pilau may be the normal rice or basmat rice but in most restaurants prefer to use the basmat rice. Pilau can be served along with salad or kachumbari or vegetables also roasted sauce. Tanzanian pilau rice is often difficult to separate from its indian roots .However when it comes to African cuisine,pilau in East Africa’s ubiquitous rice dish and often extends beyond its coastline from Zanzibar into the indian ocean islands such as Mauritius.</p>

<p><strong>Origin of Pilau.</strong><br>Basing on different literature pilau is said to organize from India though Tanzania pilau has more spices than that of india. It is said that pilau has been brought in Africa originally by the arabs and later on ,it was spread to America by the enslaved Africans. Also it is said that the name pilau derives from Persian term “polow” which is a rice mixed with things like spices ,nuts and meat. Pilau dish is also similar to Barris ( Basmati Rice Pilaf with raisins) but it is made with coconut milk and without tomato or raisins.<br>Pilau recipe.<br>Preparation of pilau involves many ingredients and one may use a charcoal stove or any other stove but majority of people in Tanzania use charcoal stove and prepare the mixture of spices on their own instead of using the pilau masala but either ways results to a perfectly cooked pilau.</p>



<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>⦁ 4 cups of rice<br>⦁ 1 kg of meat<br>⦁ 4 garlic cloves<br>⦁ Grounded ginger<br>⦁ Table salt<br>⦁ Water<br>⦁ Tomatoes<br>⦁ Clean water<br>⦁ Beef masala<br>⦁ 4 small potatoes<br>⦁ Boiled green peas<br>⦁ Cardamom seeds<br>⦁ Cooking oil<br>⦁ 3 well chopped onions</p>



<p><strong>Directions</strong><br>⦁ Cut the meat in small pieces and add salt then boil with water<br>⦁ Crush galic and cardamom together with salt by using mortar and pestle<br>⦁ Add oil in hot cooking pan then add chopped onions stir until the onions turn to golden brown.<br>⦁ Then add beef masala,crushed ginger and garlic<br>⦁ Add tomatoes and stir well until they are well cooked ,then afterwards add pilau masala and stir.<br>⦁ Add boiled meat and then stir throughout<br>⦁ Add a cup of water to the mixture then leave it to boil<br>⦁ Wash the rice and put it in the boiled water mixture add potatoes,add boilrdgreen peas then cook(while covered for 15-20 minutes over low heat until all water is dissolved and the rice is cooked through.<br>⦁ If you are reusing the charcoal put the hot charcoal on top of the sufuria lid and leave there few pieces of charcoal on bottom of cooking stove( jiko).<br>⦁ Check after 15 minutes remove the lid and stir your pilau add some water in your pilau,if its not yet ready</p>



<p><strong>Then serve the pilau with kachumbari or salad and enjoy your meal.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes its not necessary pilau to contain meat ,some people prefer to prepare pilau without me at which is nick named as pilau bubu.As a substitute people prepare roasted meat aside which is very nice too as the normal pilau nama since the same spices are used to prepare the pilau bubu.<br>Where to find pilau..<br>Pilau can be made simply at home but also in restaurants.The famous restaurant which has been operating for almost four decades is the Butiama restaurant located at Magomeni town in Dar as salaam,it serves a delicious spicy pilau at an affordable price of tsh2000-tsh 4000. Other restaurants include Harare city restaurant,Chefs pride restaurant,Swahili kitchen restaurant,sanara grill restaurant and many others.</p>



<p><strong>Why should one eat pilau…..</strong><br>As for many food types are like two sides coin ,they have advantages and side effects too. Despite this fact pilau has been chief leading food with a lot of healthy benefits which include:<br>It is a source of carbohydrates and proteins which are essential to provide energy and also body building, pilau contains rice which is rich in carbohydrates that is a energy source and the meat of either beef,goat or chicken is protein for body building and the salad served along with the dish is rich in vitamins hence making pilau dish to be a well balanced diet.</p>

<p>As a kid growing up in Tanzania’s most populated and ethnically diverse city: Dar es Salaam, I got the privilege to enjoy a broad range of traditional foods from different corners of the country. In the name of commerce, Dar unites almost all tribes of this nation, it is indeed the one place where the Tanzanian cuisine resonates in unison. After many years of stay here and as a food lover, I have been able to compare between the tastes of a variety of foods.<br>Well, my first choice is absolutely not vegan, this is the one food that you will always find in social places, it neither has sugar nor does it contain chocolate, but somehow it manages to linger in the minds of man Tanzanians nationwide. The dish is Nyama choma, Tanzania’s undisputed champion.</p>



<p><strong>What is Nyama choma and how to prepare it?</strong><br>Nyama choma is a special form of grilled meat, preferably goat meat (mbuzi choma) but can also be beef or chicken (kuku choma). It is a more crunchy, customized form of barbeque meat.<br>The cooker used is made of iron frames where the meat rests as it is turns brown from the heat provided by the hot charcoal a few centimetres from it. You can see the fats The aim of keeping it a distance away from the fire is to make sure it does not get burnt.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="604" src="https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pexels-samer-daboul-2233729-2-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5884" srcset="https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pexels-samer-daboul-2233729-2-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pexels-samer-daboul-2233729-2-300x177.jpg 300w, https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pexels-samer-daboul-2233729-2-768x453.jpg 768w, https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pexels-samer-daboul-2233729-2-1536x907.jpg 1536w, https://tzfoodplaces.github.io/fp/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pexels-samer-daboul-2233729-2-2048x1209.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Serving Nyama choma</strong><br>Nyama choma can just have salt as the main additive while some prefer squeezing a few lemons on the meat alongside a combined mixture of pepper, onions, and garlic. Nyama choma is normally eaten with either Ugali, another staple food made from maize flour stiff porridge or can be eaten together with Ndizi choma (roasted bananas). Ugali, commonly consumed with Nyama choma is prepared by cooking a porridge of maize flour until it becomes stiff.</p>



<p><strong>Where to find it.</strong><br>You can find it in many large restaurants, bars, pubs and roadside sellers all over the city. It is a favorite in social gatherings and recreational places where people drink beer while waiting for the delicious goat to be ready. The mean cooking time for Nyama choma is 90 minutes. The Ndizi choma is prepared by roasting bananas in a similar manner, except them take a shorter time to cook.</p>



<p><strong>Waiter…!</strong><br>Next time you are at that bar on a calm weekend evening and you want to order Nyama choma, this is how you do it. Nyama Choma is ordered in kilos. So, you can tell the waiter/ waitress the number of kilos you or your group think is enough. A typical family outing can consume a kilo or more. A kilo costs between 8000 to 9000 TZS.</p>

<p><strong>A visitor’s account</strong><br>Perez, a Spanish friend of mine arrived in Tanzania in the 1980’s. As a Spaniard who had lived in Kenya before coming to Dar where he normally used the terminology ‘Nyama choma’ faced a surprising welcome by most Nyama choma sellers in Tanzania who told him that he word is not correct in Swahili. Instead, they told him to say “Nyama ya Kuchoma”. It was this way in many places of the country, but it has changed over time. Now the name “Nyama choma” is the most widely used and preferred across the country.</p>



<p><strong>Future prospects</strong><br>Despite high rates of rural-urban migration, with time, the diversity in Dar es Salaam seems to be fading away slowly due to modernization, fewer visits to one’s home village and globalization. Like any other major city in the world, cultures tend to merge to create a new one. I hope the future children would get a similar experience of the diverse meals in the Tanzanian cuisine.</p>
